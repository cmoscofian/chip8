# CHIP8 EMULATOR

## Todo:
- [ ] Add error handling and validations (Should check for boundaries and possible null pointers);
- [ ] Fix movement and display issues (reproduceable in PONG).
- [ ] Trying building a simple debugger on top of the emulator.
- [ ] Trying create a unit and integration test suite.
