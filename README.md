# CHIP8 EMULATOR

## Todo:
- [x] ~~Fix movement and display issues (reproduceable in PONG).~~
- [x] ~~Trying building a simple debugger on top of the emulator.~~
- [ ] Add error handling and validations (Should check for boundaries and possible null pointers);
- [ ] Trying create a unit and integration test suite.
